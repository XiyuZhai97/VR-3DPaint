right controller
- hold trigger to draw
- swipe right-to-left to undo 1 stroke
- swipe down-to-up to increase stroke size
- swipe up-to-down to decrease stroke size
- hold down touchpad and drag side-to-side to rotate sketch

left controller
- click trigger to select color by saturation/value
- click/drag on hue bar w/ trigger held down to change hue
- point at sphere on lower left (it should turn blue) and click trackpad


----- planning notes -----

teleportation
- toggle teleportation mode by double-clicking trigger? or hold down grip,
    to avoid having it conflict with drawing
- detect when pointer intersects floor
- put a teleport sprite (maybe a sphere) at that intersection
- get those coordinates and set head transform to go there
- so would this be attached to head or to floor? it needs to move the head,
    but it needs to intersect the floor
- move color picker with you somehow

scale
- get the positions of the controllers and calc
    whether they're moving closer (smaller dist) or farther apart (bigger dist)
    - specifically when the vector btw them stays at relatively the same angle?
- and then when the vector btw them changes angle, you get that change and apply it
    to the sketch too
- I would imagine teleporting to be w/ the left hand, when you're not pointing at the color picker?

- I think maybe the stroke size change should be more drastic
- stroke width could change by clicking the upper/lower parts of the touch pad instead of swiping?
